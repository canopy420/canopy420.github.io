        <h1>Computer</h1>
        <p>You would expect that someone who likes tech has the last things on the market and all that shit, in this case thats not true.<br> For my PC i have a self-build one with 8GB of RAM DDR3, an AMD A10-5800K CPU with a AMD Radeon R7 250X GPU.<br> Many people tell me to update it but i dont see the point of it, it works fine and i can play things like DOOM Eternal and others on it<br> and i dont use it that much.<br> i currently have Arch Linux and Windows 10 on dual-boot on it.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Others</h1>
        <p>For my phone, i have an iPhone 13 (stfu i dont care about phones), For my self-hosted file server, my old laptop Primux IOXBOOK 1402MC.<br> i also have an iPad and a Macbook</p>
