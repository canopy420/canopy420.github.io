    <h1>About me</h1>
    <div class="text-border">
        <p>Hey, im Canopy (or Cano for short) a technology aficionado from Spain. <br>I made this website for me in order to practice web development like i told you in the <a href="index.html" class="highlight">Home section.</a><br>This is not my first website, in fact, some code is borrowed from my previous websites, you can still acces my last one but we are going to keep that on the low.</p>
        <p>I dont only like technology tho, i also like things like fashion, music, games, skating... And other things.</p>
        <p>if i would have to choose my favorite games, it would be TF2, Grand Theft Auto V online and Session Skate Sim<br> And for music, Lil Peep, Haunted Mound, Playboi Carti, Yeat and 6 Dogs.</p>
        <p>My name comes from a leaked Lil Peep song <a href="https://youtu.be/XgSQaGLI1vM?feature=shared" class="highlight" target="_blank">called like my alias.</a></p>
        <p>You can add me on Discord (@Can0pyy) if you need something or add me on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/PoliciaNacional/" class="highlight">Steam</a> too if you want to (i dont use it).</p>
