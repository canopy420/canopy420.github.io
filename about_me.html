        <p>Hey, I'm Canopy (or Cano for short), a technology aficionado from Spain. <br>I made this website for myself to practice web development as i mentioned <a href="index.html" class="highlight">Home section.</a><br>This is not my first website; in fact, some code is borrowed from my previous projects. You can still access my last one, but we're going to keep that on the down-low.</p>
        <p>I don't only like technology, tho, I'm also into fashion, music, games, skating, and other things. i also like things like fashion, music, games, skating... And other things.</p>
        <p>If I had to choose my favorite games, they would be TF2, Grand Theft Auto V Online, and Session Skate Sim.<br> As for music, my favorites are Lil Peep, Haunted Mound, Playboi Carti, Yeat, and 6 Dogs.</p>
        <p>My name comes from a leaked Lil Peep song <a href="https://youtu.be/XgSQaGLI1vM?feature=shared" class="highlight" target="_blank">called like my alias.</a></p>
        <p>You can add me on Discord (@Can0pyy) if you need something,or add me on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/PoliciaNacional/" class="highlight">Steam</a> too if you want to (even tho I don't really use it).</p>
